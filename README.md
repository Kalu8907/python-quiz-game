Python Quiz Game

This is a command-line Python quiz game consisting of 10 interactive questions with a total prize of â‚¹5,000. Each question rewards the player with a prize, and the game progresses only with correct answers. The project is implemented using Python lists, loops, operators, addition/increment, if-else conditions, and proper error handling, demonstrating clean coding practices and logical flow.

I built this project to learn and practice Python fundamentals and advanced concepts, including operators, control flow, and problem-solving logic, while writing code that is readable, efficient, and interactive.

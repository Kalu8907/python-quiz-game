Python Quiz Game:

Python Quiz Game is an interactive command-line project featuring 10 questions, where players can win a total prize of â‚¹5,000. Each question gives a prize and the game only continues if the player answers correctly. 

This project is implemented using Python lists, loops, operators, addition/increment operations, if-else conditions, and proper error handling, demonstrating clean coding practices and logical programming flow. 

The game was created to strengthen my Python programming skills, covering both basic and advanced concepts such as control flow, operators, functions, and logical problem-solving. It showcases my ability to write efficient, readable, and interactive code while handling errors and ensuring a smooth user experience.

This project also highlights my versatility in Python development and is included in my portfolio to demonstrate practical application of Python concepts alongside my data analysis knowledge.
